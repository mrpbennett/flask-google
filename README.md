### Next steps

Your next step could be to do the following:

- Rework the database initialization to happen separately from running the application
- Separate out the HTML/CSS from the Python code for easier management ✅
- You could use templates. ✅
- You could also load static files (like JS and CSS) from elsewhere. ✅
- Host your application in the cloud
- Purchase a domain name
- Use a real SSL certificate and get rid of that pesky warning
